### What I learned

I have used Framer Motion for the first time to develop any website. It was a fantastic learning experience for me. Framer Motion taught me a lot. This project also greatly aids my understanding of design. It was an enjoyable learning experience for me.

### Future Plan

In the future, I'll add a few features. Users will eventually be able to take quizzes from some courses. I will also implement authentication. Users who are logged in can also access their dashboard and account information.
